They provide a service by transforming a manuscript into an exploitable literary property targeted at a known market. STM journal publishers distinguish themselves by extracting maximum profit based on the potential financial value of the need-to-know research they report. In the 1990s and aided by the internet, scholars began to reassert control of journals and journal publishing. Scholarly effort has focused on transmission, that is to say, production and creation of the public record. Full control by the scholarly community must embrace the transformative nature of publishing at which point reinvolving publishers to provide a full range of publishing services would seem desirable.

Simplifying to make the point, four distinct types of publishing can be identified that provide insight into the range of publishing and that are relevant to this discussion. First is cultural publishing that is guided by the desire to contribute to public discourse and the public good. Often, cultural publishing is taken on by small publishers committed to ideas or creativity that they feel deserve to be made public. In financial terms, this type of cultural publishing is a high-risk enterprise where risks are actually increasing with the vast expansion of information and ease of accessibility. In circumstances where the market is more predictable, through the use of known authors or on topics that command public attention larger trade publishers are participants. Such activities lead to a second category, mainstream trade-book publishers that, generally speaking, are large companies made up of a number of imprints.</Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content> </Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>Large mainstream trade-book publishers bring to market books of general appeal such as Jared Diamond’s and Stephen Hawking’s insights, as well as Michael Ondaatje’s and Margaret Atwood’s fiction. In Canada such companies include Random House, HarperCollins, Penguin, and Simon and Schuster. These companies are large, and they have the wherewithal to pay substantial author advances. They are profit oriented, however, the level of profit they make is small, usually less than 10 percent. They compete for the attention of the consumer in the marketplace and for the (limited leisure) time each of us has to enjoy reading and appreciate the insights and information that authors provide us about the world.</Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content> </Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>A third type of publishing that spreads over at least three types of firms is service publishing. In contrast to cultural and trade publishing where the publisher takes on financial risk in the development of a manuscript into a publishable title, service publishing is organized somewhat differently. Trade-book and cultural publishers take on service publishing on a fee-for-service basis. A company or institution can contract with a publisher by means of up-front payments and formulas can be developed to share any earned revenues if the title is meant to be sold to the public. Service publishing is also carried out by non-publisher organizations to serve their own needs. For example, medical organizations publish a significant amount of health-oriented literature both to contributing to the public good and to sell their medical services. Similarly, governments have active online publishing programs to keep the public informed. A third type of service publishing that has expanded significantly over the last decade is (author-oriented but accessible to any individual or organization) print-on-demand publishing. Here again, publishing services are provided to clients on a fee-for-service basis that can include editing, design and layout, marketing, distribution, and so forth. In service publishing, the pursuit of profit over and above fees for services rendered takes second place.</Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content> </Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>A fourth group of publishers, led by Thomson Reuters, are the publishers of need-to-know information.

In a world where science, and particularly, physics, was seen as the foundation of such miracles as nuclear energy as well as nuclear bombs, it is not difficult to understand the strength of demand. By the time the Germans were granted the right to take back control over their own business, Maxwell had founded his own scientific journal publishing operation, Pergamon Press, and was busily flying to science and chemistry conferences around the world, finding research leaders in opening fields, and setting them up as editors of journals that he then sold, for tidy sums, to research libraries. </Content></CharacterStyleRange><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>That Maxwell was copied eventually in his pricing levels by his publishing colleagues, more than he was reviled, suggests that he was merely a leader in establishing a dynamic that was bound to emerge, a dynamic that may have had some political underpinnings.</Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content> </Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>Librarians came to refer to post-war STM journal publishing practices as causing a "serials pricing crisis." </Content></CharacterStyleRange><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content> </Content></CharacterStyleRange><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content> </Content></CharacterStyleRange><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>From the point of view of the libraries it was.

It emphasizes one element of post-war serials publishing and has become so predominant that other, rather key, elements are unacknowledged. For example, the need of governments and their science agencies and communities to mine all available research knowledge of the day generally goes undiscussed.</Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content> </Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>Just to touch on the subject, in the context of the Cold War – a period immediately following the Second World War – scientific knowledge became the battleground on which “the West” fought Communism. This being the case, not only did the West have an interest in acquiring access to German science, but also it had an interest in freeing up the communication of all research results the publication of which, for the most part, was under the control of restrictive disciplinary associations that were in a monopoly position to control the publication of members of a discipline. This included legitimizing lines of inquiry, and hence the opening of new fields and cross-discipinary fertilization that was so important to the discovery of the nature of DNA. It seems apparent that political forces would have looked favourably upon the freeing up of the communication of scientific research that Maxwell’s activities represented. In that context, the value of information circulation for which Maxwell and his followers were responsible would have far outweighed their greed in journal pricing. Higher than warranted subscription prices are a small price to pay for effectively open access to scientific research activities.</Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content> </Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>Secondly, and somewhat more speculatively, it would not be all that surprising, as Gordon and Dillon </Content></CharacterStyleRange><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>claim, for Maxwell, dealing internationally with scientists and science agencies, to have been recruited by Israel to sell high-level computers to such agencies with built-in spyware feeding top-secret information to Mossad, a role that would not only explain the treatment of Maxwell at his death by the state of Israel but also his possible murder by Mossad as he stole vast sums from his employees pensions and fought a losing battle to control his publishing empire – which no longer included STM journal publishing.</Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content> </Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>At a naïve non-political level of analysis, in wresting control from disciplinary societies, the STM publishers certainly over-charged for their product. They charged on the basis of the value of the research findings contained in the articles for which they held copyright – a value that had nothing to do with creating. That value was far in excess of their contribution of publishing services. On the academic side, librarians had very little in their arsenal to resist. For years, moral suasion fell on deaf ears among publishers, university administrators, and scientists themselves. </Content></CharacterStyleRange><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>As well, librarians were constrained by their responsibility to provide the information needed for researchers and graduate students.

High journal prices, together with the constant refrain of librarians on pricing, and continued expansion funding requests for scientific research that increased more quickly that funding available, seem to have caused a shift of opinion in the scientific community on journal pricing. That shift saw scientists change their perspective on the high prices of journals from a reflection of the value of scientific knowledge in society and the suitably exalted status of science and scientists to one in which those same prices were seen to be a unnecessary bottleneck to research communication. The actions that emerged out of the scientific community did not consist of a confrontation with the pricing or publishing policies of the commercial journal publishers. Rather, they came out of a different tradition and set of assumptions.</Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content> </Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>In 1973, computer scientist Vincent Cerf, developed the idea of the internet, an idea that came to fruition 10 years later in 1983.

First is work on the presentation of the information and ideas begun by authors and spread across editors and conscientious peer reviewers. Their task is to evaluate the significance of what authors have to say and, if what authors have to say is significant, to help them to cast their findings and analysis in a manner that brings forward the key elements and make them readily understood. This can range from drawing the authors’ attention to other relevant research to helping to restructure the argumentation or interpretation of findings. In doing so they help the author open the reader to a consideration of the full implications of the research. Copy-editing extends this work by transforming the article into a form that clarifies the content further thereby allowing the reader to concentrate on the content rather than the (in)adequacy of the expression. Complementing this language work is the visual presentation of the ideas. Those who design the presentation by laying out the article on the page – based on a pre-existing designed template – confer on the article the authority of good design and readability, at times augments by images, tabular presentations of data, and increasingly colour, sound, and moving images.

In granting monopoly to the creator (or the assigns of the creator), copyright recognizes the originating publisher as the single legitimate source of publication. To provide a point of historical context, in the years preceding the photocopier, scholar-authors were given the opportunity, at the time of printing, to purchase reprints at a reasonable cost. In turn, other researchers would send postcards to authors asking for copies that authors would dutifully send them. The article might thus circulate in the working group of the person who made the request. Such reprints supplemented library subscriptions and allowed scholars and their graduate students to collect the research they needed for further private study. Circulation of offprints was also material proof of legitimacy.</Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content> </Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>The value of copyright for scholars is attribution in the official public record of peer-reviewed (and sometimes not peer reviewed) publications and the circulation of the information copyright makes possible. The value of copyright for authors has not increased appreciably since the advent of photocopiers, or, for that matter, the advent of the internet. On the contrary, what some might consider transgressions of copyright, as well as an increased ability to take advantage of fair dealing, though photocopying and now digital copying, has been a boon to circulation of research and hence to authors. This stagnation of the benefit of copyright itself for authors derives from two phenomena. First is that authors are strongly encouraged to assign copyright to journals thereby denying authors standing as owners of their intellectual property (e.g., in any subsequent rights sale) and hence of any benefit beyond attribution. Second, scholar-authors have a direct benefit in the maximization of the increased circulation of their research results where publishers only benefit from increased paid circulation. Financial benefit for authors comes outside copyright in the form of salary increases, promotion and tenure. Reputational benefit comes from circulation and citation.</Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content> </Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>In contrast with the stagnation of copyright in serving authors’ interests, the increasingly wide purview in the application of copyright has benefitted journal publishers considerably. Thus, journals receive payments from reprography rights organizations (RROs) for secondary use of articles in course anthologies. Certain journals also receive rich payments from companies whose products are the subject of research: pharmaceutical companies pay journals for the privilege of circulating articles to their target market: doctors and other prescribers and para-subscribers. The difficulty with the relationship that has built up between medical journals and pharmaceutical companies is that so lucrative is the pharmaceutical market to journals through advertising and article distribution rights, that the pharmaceutical companies have too strong an influence on what gets published and what does not. Indeed, the pharmaceutical companies often run the research themselves and analyze the data for the collaborating author. In short, and other examples could be cited, copyright allows for derivative business in the circulation of research. However, it is rare to find any of that income returning to the researcher or to the funding of independent research. From the standpoint of the circulation of research, the sole justification for copyright, or, more precisely, for any licence more restrictive that an NC-BY-ND Creative Commons licence </Content></CharacterStyleRange><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>should be that it benefits research; either to allow a journal to continue to publish or to fund independent research.

No industry can pursue its own interests with little or no regard to consumer interests. While the power of consumers is much overplayed in capitalist market theory, in this instance, the market does have sufficient power to turn away from established STM journal publishers and create alternatives. The worldwide use of OJS that may be approaching 10,000 journals largely representing a gradual turning away from commercial publishers, is a dramatic case in point.</Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content> </Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>New business models in STM journal publishing in particular and all journal publishing in general </Content></CharacterStyleRange><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/b"><Content>are </Content></CharacterStyleRange><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>needed, and copyright practices if not copyright itself is being challenged. Setting overcharging aside, where print subscriptions represented a manner of sharing costs among those consumers able to afford to access journal content, in the context of internet-based dissemination, they create a bottleneck to the easy circulation the internet makes possible. Transactional costs (of providing journal content to researchers) could be greatly reduced in two ways. First would be by dispensing with subscriptions with their attendant management costs and second would be to convert funds provided by libraries and other subscribers into direct contributions to necessary expenditures. The amount of contributions from each source could be calibrated based on historic expenditures, enrolments, overall budgets, and so forth.</Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content> </Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>In a number of different ways, technology is undermining the commercial journal model.

Such instability is never a good thing for making money as the market is unpredictable and the risk is too high. The scholarly equivalent is scholars self-archiving and universities making essentially the same information as has been published in a journal available through their repositories. As well, a market that mixes content that is free and every bit as valuable as that which is quite costly, that is to say institutional repository and OA journal content on the one hand, and subscription-based journal content on the other hand, also cannot last because it lacks rationality.

While clarity and comprehensiveness are key, there is no argument that in increasing the ease and decreasing the expense of information distribution, the internet has made certain institutions, organizations and businesses into worldwide non-monetizing publishers foreclosing on opportunities that traditional publishers might have pursued had they been able to serve them using a monetized model.

In a sense we are back to the beginning of the Cold War where vastly increased information circulation can indeed take place and existing publishers continue to restrict it. Ironically, scholars are playing the role of Robert Maxwell, only they have stripped that role down by eschewing the seeking of profit. While it is tempting to say that this tension did not exist prior to the invention of the internet, it might be more accurate to say that the tension between the social and publishers’ interest has been greatly magnified by the internet. Prior to the internet, various institutions and practices, notably libraries, lending, and legal deposit ensured that what was publicly available was universally available to all members of the public.

The issue here is not so much copyright law as it is copyright practice. (And, quite importantly, it should be noted that practice is taken into account in the interpretation of the law.)

The internet greatly facilitates flows of non-monetized information but methods are needed to be found the underwrite the cost of the preparation of content to feed those flows. At the same time, the internet also greatly challenges the information monetization that publishers would like to prevail. There are some in the creator rights holder community who see it as appropriate to extend the reach of copyright to strengthen the ability of the vendor to circumscribe the activities of purchasers of creative works. One might call this copyright creep. Equally, there are those, following in the footsteps of French revolutionaries who would banish copyright law altogether. The milder members of this second group might be said to be engaging in fair dealing creep. And then there are many publishers, authors, purchasers, libraries and other users who see the need for balance, who recognize the value added by both authors and publishers, and who understand the benefit of a market for literary works.</Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/p"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content> </Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/h1"><CharacterStyleRange><Content>Beyond the Impasse: Re-establishing Service Publishing for the Long Term</Content><Br/></CharacterStyleRange></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/pInitial"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>It seems sensible to suggest, as others such as Fred Friend have done, </Content></CharacterStyleRange><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/[No character style]"><Content>that the academy has an opportunity and a responsibility to re-establish service publishing, similar to what existed in science journal publishing prior to the Second World War.

This would come from an operation such as Scopus that would monitor journal articles and, mimicking Google algorithms, provide citation analysis to track the impact of articles adding the kind of value that would soon become invaluable to well-funded researchers. In short, if push came to shove, commercial publishers could yield journal production to scholars and retreat to adding value through indexes and other meta-publishing initiatives that would preserve their position as profit generators, draining an unnecessary level of valuable resources from research and education.

This includes production with peer review and aggregating journals into groups that have sufficient content and interest so that access is deemed at least useful if not critical to other researchers. Out of building aggregations and the collection of data on usage will come the exchange of ideas and practices that will build increased effectiveness over a broad range of measures.

In the context of publishing, functions such as marketing become not boastful promotions of products that are unworthy, nor wastes of money, but rather an attempt to attract the attention of relevant readers.
